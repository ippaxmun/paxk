<h2> OVERVIEW <h2>
<p>
The International Press is a specialized committee with a unique function - to report and comment on the proceedings of other MUN committees. 
The Press is that segment of MUN that has the freedom to listen to debates and express independent opinions on those debates. Press members observe committees
and produce informative and creative newsletters on the discourse. Articles range from op-eds to fluffs, while pictures and caricatures often depict the 
humorous side of MUN. Through its articles, pictures and caricatures, the Press both informs and entertains all. The unique experience that the IP holds – 
ranging from frantically running through committee rooms to getting an opportunity to express your most profound thoughts about how much food means to you – 
is truly one that cannot be found anywhere else.

any information on what happened in the council/committee but concerns what the author thinks of the discussion at hand. Editorials and OpEds have to be very high in standards of writing

aspects which will not come in light otherwise in the course of the MUN. Interviews can be done with the Executive Board members, delegates, secretariat 
and various organizing committees.However, intelligent and conference pertaining issues are to be considered.

questions on probably the second or the third day of the conference, with the prior permission of your Executive Board. You will be trained and guided by 
your editor in chief for the press conference in the briefing. However, the opportunity to conduct a press conference will be subjected to the time 
constraints that the organizers have.Their permission and word will be deemed final.
